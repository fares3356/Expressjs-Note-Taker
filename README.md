## Learning Points:
* This app was a practice in writing the backend code only and then integrating it with provided front end code (index.html, notes.html, and custom jQuery)
* Practice setting up an Express server and in particular learning the importance of using the express.static() function to ensure proper delivery of local js/css files used by html files being delivered via .sendFile();
